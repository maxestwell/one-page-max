~SELF REFLECTION~

production process:
I laid out the html in logical order. I then linked the css using 'id' tag. After that I linked the js to the html page. I used the js for the navbar;similar to the example page.
understanding:
I had to relearn html because I forgot most of what I was taught previously. I also didn't know css at all. The process became stressfull because of that. I eventually became more acustomed to how they both work and figured it out for the most part. I had a hard time with JavaScript. It still confuses me so I had to do some additional research and closely match the the resources.
approach:
I took the article from the ABC's Strange Canberra. I felt like I wasn't confident or skilled enough to make something complicated in js.

Overall, I like the design of the webpage. If I could do something dfifferent next time, I would take my time to properly understand JavaScript. I feel like I learnt a lot of html and css and how they work.
